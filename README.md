# Exabeam
Sure! Here’s a project idea that demonstrates the deployment and use of Exabeam for **Advanced Threat Detection** and **Incident Response** in a simulated enterprise environment. This project showcases Exabeam’s capabilities while integrating various cybersecurity tools to detect and respond to security incidents.

### **Project Title: Deployment of Exabeam SIEM for Threat Detection and Automated Incident Response**

---

### **Objective:**
Deploy and configure **Exabeam SIEM** with **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** to detect anomalous behaviors, respond to security incidents in real-time, and improve the overall security posture of an enterprise environment.

---

### **Scope:**
- Set up **Exabeam Advanced Analytics** and integrate it with various security tools (e.g., firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS), endpoint detection and response (EDR)).
- Configure **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** to monitor and detect insider threats, anomalous activities, and potential data breaches.
- Build custom detection rules and correlation searches to fine-tune the system for your environment.
- Automate incident response workflows using **Exabeam Incident Responder** to reduce the response time.
- Create custom dashboards and reports for security operations and compliance monitoring.

---

### **Project Steps:**

### 1. **Environment Setup**
   - **Create a Simulated Network Environment**: Set up a virtual environment using VMware or cloud platforms like AWS or Azure. Include basic services like web servers, database servers, and Active Directory to replicate an enterprise environment.
   - **Deploy Security Tools**: Integrate third-party security tools (firewalls, IDS/IPS, EDR) with Exabeam to generate logs for threat detection.
   - **Log Collection**: Configure log collection from various sources, including endpoints, servers, and network devices, using **Exabeam Data Lake**.

### 2. **Deploy Exabeam SIEM**
   - **Install and Configure Exabeam**: Set up Exabeam SIEM and ensure it is properly connected to your log sources.
   - **Log Parsing and Normalization**: Configure Exabeam to parse logs from different systems (Windows, Linux, network devices) and normalize them for analysis.
   - **Integrate with Threat Intelligence**: Connect Exabeam to external threat intelligence feeds to enrich the data with context (e.g., known malicious IPs, domains).

### 3. **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**
   - **Define Behavioral Baselines**: Configure Exabeam to establish baseline behaviors for users and assets based on their typical activities (login times, file access, resource usage).
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Use UEBA to identify deviations from normal behavior, such as:
     - Privilege escalation attempts.
     - Unusual data access or exfiltration patterns.
     - Lateral movement between systems.
     - Anomalous login times or geographic locations.
   - **Insider Threat Detection**: Monitor and detect potential insider threats by identifying users who deviate from their usual activity patterns.

### 4. **Threat Detection Use Cases**
   - **Custom Detection Rules**: Build custom correlation searches and detection rules for common attack scenarios, such as:
     - Brute-force attacks.
     - Phishing attempts.
     - Malware outbreaks.
     - Unauthorized file access or privilege escalations.
   - **Alert Tuning**: Fine-tune alert thresholds to reduce false positives and focus on high-confidence alerts.
   - **Integration with SIEM Rules**: Apply Exabeam’s out-of-the-box rules for threat detection and adjust them to the environment.

### 5. **Automated Incident Response with Exabeam Incident Responder**
   - **Create Playbooks**: Design automated playbooks to handle specific types of incidents (e.g., malware detection, suspicious logins).
   - **Incident Escalation**: Configure escalation rules to notify appropriate teams when certain thresholds are met (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).
   - **Automated Mitigation**: Integrate with firewall or EDR solutions to automatically block IPs, isolate compromised systems, or disable user accounts in response to an alert.

### 6. **Reporting and Compliance**
   - **Custom Dashboards**: Create interactive dashboards in Exabeam for real-time monitoring of security incidents, user behavior, and system health.
   - **Compliance Reports**: Generate compliance reports (e.g., for **GDPR**, **PCI-DSS**, or **HIPAA**) using Exabeam’s built-in reporting capabilities.
   - **Security Metrics**: Provide detailed reports to the security operations team with metrics on incident response times, detection accuracy, and log coverage.

### 7. **Testing & Evaluation**
   - **Simulate Threat Scenarios**: Use tools like **Metasploit** or **Cobalt Strike** to simulate different attack scenarios (e.g., ransomware, lateral movement, data exfiltration) and test the detection capabilities of Exabeam.
   - **Evaluate Performance**: Measure how quickly Exabeam detects and responds to threats, and assess the impact of automated response workflows.

### 8. **Post-Incident Review**
   - **Incident Retrospective**: After each detected incident, conduct a post-incident analysis to evaluate the performance of the detection and response processes.
   - **Tuning and Optimization**: Continuously fine-tune detection rules, correlation searches, and playbooks based on the results of incident investigations.

---

### **Deliverables:**
- **Exabeam SIEM** fully integrated into the environment with real-time log collection and analysis.
- Custom **correlation rules and detection policies** for identifying security threats.
- Fully operational **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** for detecting anomalous user behavior.
- Automated **incident response playbooks** that handle common attack scenarios.
- A set of **custom reports and dashboards** for real-time monitoring and compliance tracking.

---

### **Outcomes:**
- Improved detection of **advanced persistent threats (APT)** and insider threats.
- Reduced **incident response time (MTTR)** due to automation.
- Enhanced visibility into user activities and **anomalous behavior detection** through UEBA.
- Demonstrated ability to maintain compliance with industry regulations using Exabeam’s reporting features.
